NAME
----

acharts - Astronomical Charts - A SGV astronomical charts generator.

SYNOPSIS
--------

*acharts* [-o output] config_file

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Astronomical Charts

CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

Configuration files are simple text files consisting of _sections_
enclosed in square brackets ([section]) and _configuration entries_ in the form of
\'_path_ _value_' one per line.  Values may be "quoted".

Next is a list of configuration entries along with their types and
default values.


`[core]`
~~~~~~~~
epoch _timestamp_ = J2000.0::
    Epoch used for equatorial coordinates.


location.latitude _angle_ = 0.0, .longitude _angle_ = 0.0::
    Location of the observer.  Defines horizontal coordinates.


stylesheet = ""::

    Include content of the file as an embedded CSS stylesheet.  Look
    in examples/ for a default one.


`[canvas]`
~~~~~~~~~~
dimensions.x _size_ = 297mm, .y _size_ = 210mm::
    Dimentions of output canvas.  Default is A4 paper, landscape.

`[projection]`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
type _string_ = AzimuthalEquidistant::

    Type of projection used, case-insensitive.


centre.ra _angle_ = 0d, .dec = _angle_ = 0d::

    Centre of the projection.  Usually the point of least distortions.


dimensions.ra _angle_ = 45d, .dec _angle_ = 0d::

    Size of viewport before applying projection.  Maps directly to
    canvas dimensions.  If one of the dimensions equals 0, a value
    that preserves aspect ratio will be used.

    NOTE: Units here are degrees at the centre of projection, so if
    the projection isn't equidistant, viewport will not contain ranges
    expected from simple calculation.


level _string_ = none

    Rotate canvas before rendering so that center of image is level in
    a given coordinates.  Currently only supported is 'horizon' and
    'none' (the latter meaning celestial equator).


CONFIGURATION TYPES
-------------------

Below <int> denotes an integer number, <float> -- floating point
number as understood by IEEE.  Square brackets indicate an optional
part, that might be omitted.  Types don't allow whitespace unless
stated explicitly, but it's used below for clarity.

angle
~~~~~

<float>[d [<float>m [<float>s]]]::
        Degrees.  Eg: 12.34, 12d34m, -2d34m56s.

<float>h [<float>m [<float>s]]::
        Hour angle, especially useful for right ascension.  Eg: 12.2h, 12h34m56s.

<float>r::
        Radians.  Eg: 3.14r.


timestamp
~~~~~~~~~
Point in time.

J<float>::

        Julian day.  Eg. J2000.0.


<int>:<int>[:<float>] [<int>-<int>-<int>] [<double>]:

        Date in format hh:mm:ss YYYY:MM:DD TZDIFF.  Whitespace is
        mandatory between different components. If date part is
        omitted current date from system is taken.  Interpreted as
        Julian calendar for dates up to 4 October 1582, and as
        Gregorian date since 15 October 1582.  TZDIFF is timezone
        difference between UTC in hours (can be fractional).


now::

        Time taken from system clock at acharts' start.


length
~~~~~~
Length in SVG output units.

<double>[mm]::

        Millimeters.


PROJECTIONS
-----------

To map catalogue data unto a flat canvas, *acharts* needs to project
spherical coordinates to canvas coordinates on a plane.  Available
projections include:

AzimuthalEquidistant::

        Preserves distances and angles measured from the centre of
        projection.  Although it doesn't preserve any other lenghts or
        angles it produces good looking results for charts that cover
        up to 1/3 of sphere area and is therefore a default
        projection.  In the simplest form, with projection centre at
        celestial pole, supposedly known to ancient Egyptians.  Some
        countries erroneously insist on calling it Postel projection.
